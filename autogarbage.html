            <p class="section-text-p1">This automatic garbage bin allows the user to throw their trash away 
            without touching the lid. This prevents the transfer of germs and bacteria between the lid and user
            which minimizes the risk of contracting any type of illness. Although not a very complicated design 
            and still can be found over the world, this project gives myself more practice with arduino and 
            the engineering process.

            <h1 class="title">How It Works</h1>
            <p class="section-text-p1">Similarly with the Automatic Door, The door opens when an object is 
            close enough for the ultrasonic sensor to be detected. This "checking" process is constantly 
            happening in a while loop where it issetting the servo motor to its closed position as its default 
            condition. Once an object is detected,the code changes its condition which the angle of the servo 
            motor changes to the open position,swinging the door open. The "checking" process is also running 
            for this loop as it needs to detect the instant the object moves out of the sensors detection 
            vicinity. Once this happens the defualt condition will run. This cycle will run until power is no 
            longer supplied to the Arduino Uno.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Challenges and Takeaways</h1>
            <p class="section-text-p1">Some challeneges included finding the optimal rest and open position
            for the servo mortor and how the motor will be attatched to the lid. To find the optimal rest 
            position, the servo motor was first coded at position 0 and slowly increased until the arm was
            parallel with the door and motor. The next proablem arose and a short term fix was a applied which 
            was to tape the arm and door together however, the tape could not hold the everthing together without 
            falling apart. Thus, duct tape had to be bought which was a stronger alternative to hold things together.
            Once attacthed, the motor was once again coded at serveral positions until a position that reflected an 
            open position was reached. To attach the motor and lid, 2 options were considered. The first one was
            to tape a whole carboard stick against the lid to work as a lever, or just attach the top to work as a 
            pole to lift the lid up. Since tape was the adhesive chosen, the first option did not work as well since 
            moving the arm meant moving the whole motor as more strength was put in the arm. Thus, the second option 
            was chosen.

            <h1 class="title">Future Improvements</h1>
            <p class="section-text-p1">To improve this project, the cardboard used to make the garbage container
            can be upgraded with stronger and more aesthetically pleaseing materials. This would lead to a 
            stronger motor and adhesive such as hot glue would be needed to tie everything together. This would 
            also solve many of the placement problems as some objects are harder to tape which means the object 
            was more free to move around leading to dimensioning errors. Since we are using superior materias,
            chaging the way the motor is connected to the lid as a lever is a better option as it allows for a 
            wider range of motion.
